# Portfolio Assignment for Class 4

The challenge for your portfolio assignment is a bigger bite today: use jQuery to create an image carousel for your portfolio that showcases at least 3 images (maybe a photo of you, a screencap of some code, and something pertaining to one of your personal interests or experiences). You are expected to build this from the ground up: use of carousel features of frameworks like Bootstrap or use of a library other than jQuery is not permitted.

In addition, continue adding more content to your portfolio components today such that it begins to transform away from a basic wireframe and more toward a skeleton of your eventual finished product.

There is a variety of ways that an image carousel could look and work. Here are some examples:

***You get the idea.***

How you choose to implement this is up to you. It is not expected that you will build something fancy and snazzy right out the gate. Think through the incremental steps of putting together something like this, and make progress on those steps, one by one:

- You'll need a DOM container for the carousel.
- You'll need to get your images picked out, resized, and stored in a directory in your portfolio repo.
- Think back to BusMall (those of you who took 201) and think about how we can use JS and CSS to manage images.
- Take a look at [jQuery's .animate() method](http://api.jquery.com/animate/)
- Come up with a concept of how you want the carousel to work, sketching out diagrams on paper and thinking about the logic and processes involved:

	- When do things move?
	- In what order do things move?
	- Is the movement automated or triggered by user interaction?
	- Is the progression of images intended to tell some kind of a story?

- Most importantly, **have a solid plan in place for what you are trying to build before you start trying to build it.** This is not something you can just kind of wiggle into place by toying around with code unless you have a plan to work toward.

As always, do your work on a non-master branch (***class-04*** would be a good branch name, *hint hint*) and submit your last PR in Canvas as usual.
